## Kohler Visual Neuroscience Laboratory: Wallpaper Maker

This is a repository of code designed to create [wallpaper groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallpaper_group). 
* The code will generate an arbitrary number of exemplars belonging to each of the 17 groups, as well as matched control exemplars using phase-scrambling and Portilla-Simoncelli scrambling.	
* The Matlab code is a fork of (https://github.com/leksea/WPGeneratorDev), and will not be updated further.
* The Python code is under current development.
